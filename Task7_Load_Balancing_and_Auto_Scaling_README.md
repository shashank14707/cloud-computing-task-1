# ‚òÅ Task 7: Configure Load Balancing and Auto Scaling for a Web Application

## üéØ Objective

To understand **scalability** and **fault tolerance** in cloud computing by setting up a **Load Balancer** and **Auto Scaling group** for a simple web application running on multiple virtual machines.

This task demonstrates how cloud systems ensure **high availability**, **traffic management**, and **cost-efficient scaling** automatically.

---

## üõ† Tools (Free & Beginner-Friendly)

Choose **any one** platform:

- **AWS (Free Tier)** ‚Äì EC2 + Elastic Load Balancer + Auto Scaling  
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** ‚Äì Compute Engine + Load Balancer + Instance Group  
- **Microsoft Azure** ‚Äì Virtual Machine Scale Sets + Load Balancer  

### Local Tools:
- Web browser  
- VS Code or any code editor  
- Terminal / Cloud Shell

## üì¶ Deliverables

Submit the following screenshots:
1. Load Balancer dashboard showing backend instances  
2. Auto Scaling configuration page  
3. Public load balancer URL (showing your running web app)  

### Short Note (4‚Äì5 lines)
Explain how your setup works and what happens during auto scaling.

## üß≠ Mini Guide (Step-by-Step)

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Basic Web App Template**

Create a simple HTML file named `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Cloud Auto Scaling Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h2>Hello from my Cloud Instance!</h2>
  <p>This page is served from a cloud VM behind a load balancer.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

You can upload this file to multiple VMs or use a startup script to deploy it automatically using **nginx** or **apache**.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Launch Multiple VM Instances**

1. Go to your cloud console (e.g., AWS EC2 ‚Üí Launch Instances).  
2. Create **2 or more small VMs (t2.micro / e2-micro)**.  
3. Install a web server:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo systemctl start apache2
```

4. Copy your HTML file to the web directory:

```bash
sudo cp index.html /var/www/html/
```

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up a Load Balancer**

1. Create a **Load Balancer** (HTTP type).  
2. Add your VM instances as **backend servers**.  
3. Configure **health checks** (HTTP on port 80).  
4. Obtain the **public URL/IP** of the load balancer.

‚úÖ **Test:** Visit the load balancer URL ‚Äî your webpage should load successfully.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Auto Scaling**

1. Create an **Auto Scaling Group**:  
   - Choose your VM template (AMI or instance group)  
   - Define:
     - Minimum: `1`
     - Desired: `2`
     - Maximum: `4`  
   - Set scaling trigger: **CPU Utilization > 60%**

When traffic increases ‚Üí new VMs are created.  
When traffic decreases ‚Üí extra VMs are terminated (cost-efficient).

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Scaling**

Run a simple load test:

```bash
ab -n 500 -c 50 http://your-load-balancer-url/
```

Observe in your console ‚Äî new instances should launch automatically.

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Monitor and Clean Up**

- Monitor **metrics dashboard** (CPU, network, scaling history).  
- After testing, **delete all resources** to avoid charges.

---

## üß† Outcome

After completing this task, you will:

- Understand **load balancing** and **auto scaling** concepts  
- Learn how cloud maintains **availability** and **performance**  
- Get hands-on experience with **instance groups** and **health checks**  
- Gain knowledge of **scalable architecture design**
